Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! allows a user input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user enters a burger name 
 the app will display the burger on the left side of the page under waiting to be devoured.

Each burger creation in the waiting area can be devoured by the Devoure it button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page indicating that the burger has now been devoured.
